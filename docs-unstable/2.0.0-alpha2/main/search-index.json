Update Only - If the changes to the role&#8217;s spec do not include a change to the replica count then a rolling upgrade is performed of the existing cluster members. Rolling Upgrade - A rolling upgrade is actually performed out of the box by the StatefulSet associated to the role. To upgrade the members of a role the CoherenceRole controller only has to update the CoherenceInternal spec. This will cause the Helm controller to update the associated Helm install whivh in turn causes the StatefulSet to perform a rolling update of the associated Pods. Scaling - The CoherenceOperator supports safe scaling of the members of a role. This means that a scaling operation will not take place unless the members of the role are Status HA. Safe scaling means that the number of replicas is scaled one at a time untile the desired size is reached with a Status HA check being performed before each member is added or removed. The exact action is controlled by a customer defined scaling policy that is part of the role&#8217;s spec. There are three policy types: SafeScaling - the safe scaling policy means that regardless of whether a role is being scaled up or down the size is always scaled one at a time with a Status HA check before each member is added or removed. ParallelScaling - with parallel scaling no Status HA check is performed, a role is scaled to the desired size by adding or removing the required number of members at the same time. For a storage enabled role with this policy scaling down could result in data loss. Ths policy is intended for storage disabled roles where it allows for fatser start and scaling times. ParallelUpSafeDownScaling - this policy is the default scaling policy. It means that when scaling up the required number of members is added all at once but when scaling down members are removed one at a time with a Status HA check before each removal. This policy allows clusters to start and scale up fatser whilst protecting from data loss when scaling down. Delete - As with a CoherenceCluster, when a CoherenceRole is deleted its corresponding CoherenceInternal resource is also deleted by a cascading delete in k8s. The CoherenceRole controller does not need to take any action on deletion. ",

            "text": " The high level operation of the Coherence Operator can be seen in the diagram below. The entry point to the operator is the`main()` function in the cmd/manager/main.go file. This function performs the creation and initialisation of the three controllers and the ReST server. It also creates a configuration k8s secret that is used by Coherence Pods. The Coherence Operator works in a single namespace, that is it manages CRDs and hence Coherence clusters only in the same namespace that it is installed into. Controllers In the Operator SDK framework a controller is responsible for managing a specific CRD. A single controller could, in theory, manage multiple CRDs but it is clearer and simpler to keep them separate. The Coherence Operator has three controllers, two are part of the operator source code and one is provided by the Operator SDK framework. All controllers have a Reconcile function that is triggered by events from Kubernetes for resources that the controller is listening to. CoherenceCluster Controller The CoherenceCluster controller manages instances of the CoherenceCluster CRD. The source for this controller is in the pkg/controller/coherencecluster/coherencecluster_controller.go file. The CoherenceCluster controller listens for events related to CoherenceCluster CRDs created or modified in the namespace that the operator is running in. It also listens to events for any CoherenceRole CRD that it owns. When a CoherenceCluster resource is created or modified a CoherenceRole is created (or modified or deleted) for each role in the CoherenceCluster spec. Each time a k8s event is raised for a CoherenceCluster or CoherenceRole resource the Reconcile method on the CoherenceCluster controller is called. Create - When a CoherenceCluster is created the controller will work out how many roles are present in the spec. For each role that has a Replica count greater than zero a CoherenceRole is created in k8s. When a CoherenceRole is created it is associated to the parent CoherenceCluster so that k8s can track ownership of related resources (this is used for cascade delete - see below). Update - When a CoherenceCluster is updated the controller will work out what the roles in the updated spec should be. It then compares these roles to the currently deployed CoherenceRoles for that cluster. It then creates, updates or deletes CoherenceRoles as required. Delete - When a CoherenceCluster is deleted the controller does not currently need to do anything. This is because k8s has cascade delete functionality that allows related resources to be deleted together (a little like cascade delete in a database). When a CoherenceCluster is deleted then any related CoherenceRoles will be deleted and also any resources that have those CoherenceRoles as owners (i.e. the corresponding CoherenceInternal resources) CoherenceRole Controller The CoherenceRole controller manages instances of the CoherenceRole CRD. The source for this controller is in the pkg/controller/coherencerole/coherencerole_controller.go file. The CoherenceRole controller listens for events related to CoherenceRole CRDs created or modified in the namespace that the operator is running in. It also listens to events for any StatefulSet resources that were created by the corresponding Helm install for the role. When a CoherenceRole resource is created or modified a corresponding CoherenceInternal resource is created (or modified or deleted) from the role&#8217;s spec. Creation of a CoherenceInternal resource will trigger a Helm install of the Coherence Helm chart by the Helm Controller. Each time a k8s event is raised for a CoherenceRole or for a StatefulSet resource related to the role the Reconcile method on the CoherenceRole controller is called. The StatefulSet resource is listened to as a way to keep track of the state fo the role, i.e how many replicas are actually running and ready compared to the desired state. The StatefulSet is also used to obtain references to the Pods that make up the role when performing a StatusHA check prior to scaling. Create - When a CoherenceRole is created a corresponding CoherenceInternal resource will be created in k8s. Update - When a CoherenceRole is updated one of three actions can take place. Scale Up - If the update increases the role&#8217;s replica count then the role is being scaled up. The role&#8217;s spec is first checked to determine whether anything else has changed, if it has a rolling upgrade is performed first to bring the existing members up to the desired spec. After any possible the upgrade then the role&#8217;s member count is scaled up. Scale Down - If the update decreases the role&#8217;s replica count then the role is being scaled down. The member count of the role is scaled down and then the role&#8217;s spec is checked to determine whether anything else has changed, if it has a rolling upgrade is performed to bring the remaining members up to the desired spec. Update Only - If the changes to the role&#8217;s spec do not include a change to the replica count then a rolling upgrade is performed of the existing cluster members. Rolling Upgrade - A rolling upgrade is actually performed out of the box by the StatefulSet associated to the role. To upgrade the members of a role the CoherenceRole controller only has to update the CoherenceInternal spec.

For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: gc: collector: CMS roles: - role: data jvm: gc: collector: G1 - role: proxy The default garbage collector us set to CMS which will be used by all roles in the roles list that do not set a specific collector to use. The data role overrides the default collector so that the JVMs for the data role will use the G1 garbage collector The proxy role does not specify a collector to use so that JVMs for the proxy role will use the CMS garbage collector Configuring Garbage Collector Arguments Arbitrary GC arguments can be passed to the JVM in the jvm.gc.args field. This field is a string array where each argument to be passed to the JVM is a separate string value. Setting Garbage Collector Arguments for the Implicit Role When creating a CoherenceCluster with a single implicit role the GC arguments are set in the spec.jvm.gc.args field. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: gc: args: - \"-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500\" - \"-XX:G1ReservePercent=20\" The implicit storage role will have the additional GC arguments -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500 and -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 passed to the JVM. Setting Garbage Collector Arguments for Explicit Roles When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles the GC arguments are set in the jvm.gc.args field for each role in the roles list. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: roles: - role: data jvm: gc: args: - \"-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500\" - \"-XX:G1ReservePercent=20\" - role: proxy jvm: gc: args: - \"-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=1000\" The explicit data role will have the additional GC arguments -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500 and -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 passed to the JVM. The explicit proxy role will have the additional GC argument -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=1000 passed to the JVM. Setting Garbage Collector Arguments for Explicit Roles with a Default When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles a default GC arguments are set in the spec.jvm.gc.args field and will be applied to all roles in the roles list that do not set specific GC arguments. GC arguments set for explicit roles override the defaults. The role&#8217;s GC arguments are not merged with the default GC arguments. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: gc: args: - \"-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500\" - \"-XX:G1ReservePercent=20\" roles: - role: data - role: proxy jvm: gc: args: - \"-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=1000\" The default GC arguments are -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500 and -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 The data role does not specify any GC arguments so the default arguments of -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500 and -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 will be passed to the data role JVMs. The proxy role specifies the GC arguments -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=1000 which will override the defaults so only -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=1000 will be passed to the proxy role JVMs. Configuring Garbage Collector Logging The Coherence documentation recommends enabling GC logging for Coherence JVMs. To this end the CoherenceCluster CRD has a boolean field jvm.gc.logging to enable or disable default GC logging JVM arguments. By default the value of this field is set to true if it is not specified for a CoherenceCluster . The following GC logging JVM arguments are added if the jvm.gc.logging field is omitted or explicitly set to true : <markup >-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime -XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime Configuring Garbage Collector Logging for the Implicit Role When creating a CoherenceCluster with a single implicit role GC logging can be enabled or disabled in the spec section of the yaml. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: gc: logging: true The implicit storage role has GC logging explicitly enabled so that the JVM arguments listed above will be added to the JVM&#8217;s command line. Configuring Garbage Collector Logging for Explicit Roles When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles GC logging can be enabled or disabled in the jvm.gc.logging field of each role in the roles list. section of the yaml For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: roles: - role: data jvm: gc: logging: true - role: proxy jvm: gc: logging: false The data role has GC logging explicitly enabled so that the JVM arguments listed above will be added to the JVM&#8217;s command line The proxy role has GC logging explicitly disabled so that the JVM arguments listed above will not be added to the JVM&#8217;s command line Configuring Garbage Collector Logging for Explicit Roles with a Default When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles a default GC logging setting can be specified in the spec section of the CRD which can then be overridden for individual roles in the roles list. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: gc: logging: false roles: - role: data jvm: gc: logging: true - role: proxy The default value for jvm.gc.logging is false, which will disable GC logging. The data role overrides the default and sets GC logging to true The proxy role does not specify a value for jvm.gc.logging so it will use the default, which will disable GC logging. ",

Generating a heap dump is useful to diagnose why the JVM had the OOM error.

            "text": " The JVM has a number of options that can be set to fix the size of different memory regions. The CoherenceCluster CRD provides fields to set that most common values. None of these fields have default values so if they are not specified the JVMs default behaviour will apply. The memory options that can be configured are: Heap Size Metaspace size Stack size Max Native Memory Native Memory Tracking Behaviour on Out Of Memory Error If the Pod resource limits are being set to limit memory usage of a Pod it is recommended that some of the JVM memory regions are fixed to ensure that the JVM does not exceed the container&#8217;s resource limits in a JVM before Java 10. Prior to Java 10 the JVM could see all of the memory available to a machine regardless of any Pod limits. The JVM could then easily attempt to consume more memory that the Pod or Container was allowed and consequently crashing the Pod . With Coherence images that use a version of Java above 10 this issue is less of a problem. Even so if using the resources section of the configuration to limit a Pod or Containers memory it is a good idea to limit the JVM heap. Also see the useContainerLimits setting . JVM Heap Size It is good practice to fix the Coherence JVM heap size and to set both the JVM -Xmx and -Xms options to the same value. The heap size of the JVM can be configured for roles in the jvm.heapSize field of a role spec. If the heapSize value is configured then that value is applied to bot the JVMs minimum and maximum heap sizes (i.e. used to set both -Xms and - Xmx ). The format of the value of the heapSize field is any valid value that can be used when setting the -Xmx JVM option, for example 10G would set a 10 GB heap. Setting the JVM Heap Size for the Implicit Role When creating a CoherenceCluster with a single implicit role the heapSize is set in the spec.jvm section of the configuration. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: memory: heapSize: 10g The Coherence JVM for the implicit role defined above will have a 10 GB heap. Equivalent to passing -Xms10g -Xmx10g to the JVM. Setting the JVM Heap Size for Explicit Roles When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles the heapSize is set in the jvm section of the configuration for each role in the roles list. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: roles: - role: data jvm: memory: heapSize: 10g - role: proxy jvm: memory: heapSize: 500m The Coherence JVM for the data role defined above will have a 10 GB heap. Equivalent to passing -Xms10g -Xmx10g to the JVM. The Coherence JVM for the proxy role defined above will have a 500 MB heap. Equivalent to passing -Xms500m -Xmx500m to the JVM. Setting the JVM Heap Size for Explicit Roles with a Default When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles a default heapSize value can be set in the CoherenceCluster spec section that will apply to all of the roles in the roles list unless specifically overridden by a role&#8217;s jvm.heapSize field. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: memory: heapSize: 500m roles: - role: data jvm: memory: heapSize: 10g - role: proxy - role: web The default max heap size of 500 MB will be applied to all of the roles in the cluster unless overridden for a specific role. The data role overrides the default value to set the max heap for all JVMs in the data role to 10 GB. Equivalent to passing -Xms10g -Xmx10g to the JVM. The proxy role does not specify a heapSize value so it will use the default value of 500 MB. The web role does not specify a heapSize value so it will use the default value of 500 MB. JVM Metaspace Size The metaspace size is the amount of native memory that can be allocated for class metadata. By default the JVM does not limit this size. When running in size limited containers this size may be set to ensure that the JVM does not cause the container to exceed its configured memory limits. The metaspace size is set using the jvm.memory.metaspaceSize field. Setting this field causes the -XX:MetaspaceSize and -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize JVM arguments to be set. There is no default value for the metaspaceSize field so if it is omitted the JVMs default behaviour will control the metaspace size. Configuring the JVM Metaspace Size for the Implicit Role When creating a CoherenceCluster with a single implicit role the metaspace size can be set in the spec section of the CRD. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: memory: metaspaceSize: 256m The metaspace size will for the implicit storage role will be set to 256m by setting the JVM arguments -XX:MetaspaceSize=256m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m Configuring the JVM Metaspace Size for Explicit Roles When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles the metaspace size can be set in the jvm.memory.metaspaceSize field for each role in the roles list.

The stack size is configured in for roles in a CoherenceCluster by setitng the jvm.memory`stackSize field. Setting this fields sets the -Xss JVM argument. Omitting this fields does not set the -Xss argument leaving the JVM to its default configuration which sets the stack size based on the O/S being used. Configuring the JVM Stack Size for the Implicit Role When creating a CoherenceCluster with a single implicit role the stack size can be set in the spec section of CRD. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: memory: stackSize: 1024k The stack size for the implicit storage role is set to 1024k which will cause the -Xss1024k argument to be passed to the JVM. Configuring the JVM Stack Size for Explicit Roles When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: roles: - role: data jvm: memory: stackSize: 512k - role: proxy jvm: memory: stackSize: 1024k The stack size for the data role is set to 512k which will cause the -Xss512k argument to be passed to the JVM. The stack size for the proxy role is set to 1024k which will cause the -Xss1024k argument to be passed to the JVM. Configuring the JVM Stack Size for Explicit Roles with a Default When creating a CoherenceCluster with one or more explicit roles a default stack size can be set in the spec section of the yaml that will apply to all roles in the roles list unless overridden for a specific role.

The stack size for the data role is specifically set to 512k which will cause the -Xss512k argument to be passed to the JVMs for the data role. The stack size for the proxy role is not configured so the default value will be used which will cause the -Xss1024k argument to be passed to the JVMs for the proxy role. JVM Native Memory Size Native memory is used by the JVM and by Coherence for a number of reasons. In a resource limited container it may be useful to limit the amount of nio memory available to the JVM to stop the JVM exceeding the containers memory limits. The nio size is set using the jvm.directMemorySize field which will cause the -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize JVM argument to be set. There is no default value for the jvm.directMemorySize field so if it is omitted the JVM&#8217;s default size will be used. Configuring the JVM Native Memory Size for the Implicit Role When creating a CoherenceCluster with a single implicit role <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: jvm: memory: directMemorySize: 2g the maximum direct memory size for the implicit storage role is set to 2g causing the -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=2g argument to be passed to the JVM.

A cluster usually has at least one role where Pods are storage enabled. Each role in a Coherence cluster has a name and configuration.

Enabling Management Over ReST for the Implicit Role When configuring a single implicit role in a CoherenceCluster the management over ReST API can be enabled by setting the coherence.management.enabled to true in the CoherenceCluster spec section. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: coherence: management: enabled: true Management over ReST will be enabled and the http endpoint will bind to port 30000 in the container. The port is not exposed in a Service . Enabling Management Over ReST for Explicit Roles When configuring a explicit roles in the roles list of a CoherenceCluster the management over ReST API can be enabled or disabled by setting the coherence.management.enabled for each role. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: roles: - role: data coherence: management: enabled: true - role: proxy coherence: management: enabled: false The data role has the management over ReST enabled. The proxy role has the management over ReST disabled. Enabling Management Over ReST for Explicit Roles with a Default When configuring a explicit roles in the roles list of a CoherenceCluster a default value for the coherence.management.enabled field can be set in the CoherenceCluster spec section that will apply to all roles in the roles list unless overridden for a specific role. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: coherence: management: enabled: true roles: - role: data - role: proxy coherence: management: enabled: false The default value for enabling management over ReST is true which will apply to all roles in the roles list unless the field is specifically overridden. The data role does not specify a value for the coherence.management.enabled field so it will use the default value of true so management over ReST will be enabled. The proxy role overrides the default value for the coherence.management.enabled field and sets it to false so management over ReST will be disabled. Exposing the Management over ReST API via a Service Enabling management over ReST only enables the http server so that the endpoint is available in the container. If external access to the API is required via a service then the port needs to be exposed just like any other additional ports as described in Expose Ports and Services . For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: coherence: management: enabled: true ports: - name: management port: 30000 Management over ReST will be enabled and the default port value will be used so that the http endpoint will bind to port 30000 in the container. An additional port named management is added to the ports array which will cause the management port to be exposed on a service. The port specified is 30000 as that is the default port that the management API will bind to. Expose Management Over ReST on a Different Port The default port in the container that the management API uses is 30000. It is possible to change ths port using the coherence.management.port field. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: coherence: management: enabled: true port: 9000 ports: - name: management port: 9000 Management over ReST is enabled and configured to bind to port 9000 in the container.

For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: ports: - name: http port: 8080 service: annotations: key1 : value1 key2 : value2 The http port created from the yaml above will be exposed on a service that looks like the following: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: test-cluster-storage annotations: key1 : value1 key2 : value2 spec: ports: - name: http port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 The additional annotations from the http port&#8217;s service configuration have been added to the Service Adding Service Labels It is possible to add extra labels to the Service created for a port by adding additional labels to the service.labels field. The format of the labels is exactly the same as when creating a Kubernetes Service as also documented in the Kubernetes labels documentation. For example: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1 kind: CoherenceCluster metadata: name: test-cluster spec: ports: - name: http port: 8080 service: labels: key1 : value1 key2 : value2 The http port created from the yaml above will be exposed on a service that looks like the following: <markup lang=\"yaml\" >apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: test-cluster-storage labels: key1 : value1 key2 : value2 spec: ports: - name: http port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 The additional labels from the http port&#8217;s service configuration have been added to the Service ",

The Coherence Operator uses an internal crd named CoherenceRole to represent a role in a Coherence Cluster.
