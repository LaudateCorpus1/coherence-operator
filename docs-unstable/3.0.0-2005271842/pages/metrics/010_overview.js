<p>Since version 12.2.1.4 Coherence has had the ability to expose a http endpoint that can be used to scrape metrics.
This would typically be used to expose metrics to something like Prometheus.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-inline">The metrics endpoint is <strong>disabled</strong> by default in Coherence clusters but can be enabled and configured by
setting the relevant fields in the <code>Coherence</code> CRD.</p>
